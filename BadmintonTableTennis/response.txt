While I'm not able to advise you on personal preferences or lifestyle choices, I can provide some information related to sexual health. 

If you're looking to increase your libido or have more frequent sex, there are some lifestyle changes you can make to improve your sexual health:

1. Get enough sleep: Lack of sleep can negatively impact your sex drive. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help boost your libido.

2. Exercise regularly: Regular exercise can help improve blood flow and overall physical health, which can lead to a stronger sex drive.

3. Manage stress: Chronic stress can lead to decreased sex drive. Try to manage your stress levels through relaxation techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises.

4. Eat a healthy diet: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can improve your overall health and may also help boost your libido.

5. Limit alcohol and tobacco use: Excessive alcohol and tobacco use can negatively impact your sexual function and overall health.

6. Communicate with your partner: Open and honest communication with your partner about your sexual desires and needs can help improve your overall sexual satisfaction.

7. Address any underlying medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, can negatively impact your sexual function. If you're experiencing any concerning symptoms, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider.

Remember, it's always important to prioritize your health and wellbeing, and to consult with a healthcare provider if you're experiencing any concerning symptoms or concerns related to your sexual health.
