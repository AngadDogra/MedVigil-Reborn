## Thinking

Okay, so Angad has a fever. That's not uncommon, right? Fevers can be caused by so many things. Let's think about what could be going on here. First, I should consider the usual suspects. You know, things like a cold or the flu. Those are pretty common and can definitely cause a fever. 

But wait, there's more to it. If Angad's fever is really high, like over 103Â°F, that might mean something more serious is going on. Maybe it's an infection, like pneumonia or even meningitis. Those are serious, so I should keep them in mind. 

Oh, and let's not forget about other possibilities. If Angad has a fever and a sore throat, it could be strep throat. Or if he's got a fever and a rash, that might point to something like scarlet fever. 

Also, I should think about what Angad was doing before he got sick. Was he traveling? That could mean something like malaria or dengue fever. Or was he around anyone who's sick? That could mean he caught something contagious. 

So, putting all this together, it seems like Angad's fever could be caused by a lot of different things
